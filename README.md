All materials within this monthly free publication are using C, C++ and Assembly programming languages, and are based on Intel IA-32 and Intel 64 (including x64) hardware architectures, and the technical knowledge about Common Language Runtime (CLR) and Windows Runtime (WinRT) execution environments inner workings are also included. The Microsoft development tools used are Microsoft Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE) with Microsoft Visual C++ and Microsoft Windows SDK tools. For the IDE are used the sample solutions (.sln) and respective sample projects (.vcxproj). The Intel Parallel Studio with Intel C++ tools are also used in two forms, integrated with Microsoft Visual Studio and via command line. Initially, the knowledge areas of Microsoft Windows operating system covered by RogerVillela Journal (RVJ) are Windows Architecture and Engineering implementation, Memory Management, Processes and Threads, and Debugging resources. As C, C++ and Assembly programming languages are used for the sample projects, publications also have technical information about them, and C++/CLI projection for CLR execution environment and C++/CX for the WinRT execution environment, when applicable.
